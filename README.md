# Zoo Simulation Project

This project is a simulation of a zoo environment where various animals interact with each other and with visitors. The goal of the project is to create a dynamic environment where animals can eat, 
sleep, and interact with each other and the park's visitors.

## Files

1. **zoo.py**: Contains the main logic for the zoo simulation. It manages the overall simulation of a day in the zoo, including interactions between animals and visitors.

2. **animal.py**: Defines the Animal, Herbivore, and Carnivore classes, which represent the different types of animals in the zoo. It also includes specific subclasses for different animal species.

3. **food.py**: Defines the Food class, which represents the food available in the zoo. It includes methods for determining the type of food and managing food quantities.

## Features
- Creation of specific animal species such as lions, elephants, and giraffes, with unique characteristics and behaviors.
- Implementation of interactions between animals, such as hunting or playing.
- Allow visitors to feed certain animal species, affecting their energy levels.
- Simulation of a day in the zoo, where animals follow their natural routines and interact with visitors.

## Challenges
- Managing the energy levels of animals and ensuring they eat and rest regularly.
- Modeling predator-prey relationships in a way that is balanced and doesn't lead to any species quickly being eradicated from the simulation.
- Creating an engaging and interactive experience for the visitor through the interface.

## How to Use
To run the zoo simulation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the command `python zoo.py` to start the simulation.
